        Welcome to A4tab.net! Here you'll find guitar tabs and chords which are optimized for printing on one
        side of A4 (aka letter) paper. What's so great about that? Well:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Great for singalongs and jams - you don't need to turn the page halfway through a song</li>
        <li>All our tabs have ALL the lyrics for the songs - again, great for singalongs</li>
        <li>More readable (vs printing in 2-up mode)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Our tabs are also good for viewing on an ebook reader like a Kindle.
    </p>
    <p>
        To print, all you need to do is just go File -> Print in your browser and the tabs should print nicely without any headings or guff.
